FOLDER SELECTION FAQ
====================================================

Q: Do I need to select a specific folder in Railway/Vercel?
A: NO! Both platforms auto-detect your project structure.

   They automatically find:
   ✅ package.json (in root folder)
   ✅ server/ folder (backend)
   ✅ client/ folder (frontend)
   ✅ vite.config.ts (build config)
   
   NO FOLDER SELECTION NEEDED!

====================================================
